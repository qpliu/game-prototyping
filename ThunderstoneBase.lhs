Prototype the Thunderstone base game.  Avoid the complexities of the
expansions to work out how to implement the basic mechanisms.

For those who do not know Haskell, please note that return does not
mean the same thing it means in most other languages.  It does not
cause the function being defined to exit with the given value.  (Most
of the time, return takes a value of type t and returns a value of
type IO t.  In this file, return takes a value of type t and returns
a value of type Thunderstone t.  Both are special cases of the
generic type signature return :: Monad m => a -> m a, which, in
Java syntax would be
    <A, M<A> extends Monad<A>> M<A> returnMonad(A a);
or something like that.)


I'm pretty happy with the game setup code.  I like the functions
firstGame, randomizedGame and specifiedGame.

I'm pretty happy with Card and HeroCard, MonsterCard, VillageCard,
and ThunderstoneCard data structures, which are exported.  I'm not
so happy with the CardDetails and the CardProperties data structures,
which are not exported.

I'm somewhat satisfied with the exported interface, though I am
not so happy with ThunderstonePlayerState or PlayerOption.

I like the model of PlayerActions transforming the ThunderstoneState
and yielding ThunderstoneEvents, as well as having
ThunderstonePlayerState contain all the valid PlayerActions, but
I'm not satisfied with PlayerActions, which still remains mostly
undefined.

The internal PlayerState is messy and mostly undefined.  The same is
true of the internal CardProperties.  The inchoate vision of how
the dungeon will work is to have the cardBattleResult of the
CardProperties of the MonsterCard contain the code that resolves
the battle.  It's hard to see how to avoid lots of special casing.

Exported functions:

Initialize the state with the random number generator.

Start a game, specifying the number of players and choosing which
cards are in the game, which can be either a specific set of cards,
or randomly chosen cards.

A player takes an action.  If the action is legal, the updated state
and a list of events are returned.

The cards for the first game.

> firstGame :: GameSetup

>     village = [BattleFury, Fireball, FlamingSword, LightstoneGem,
>                MagicalAura, ShortSword, Spear, TownGuard]

Use the Randomizer cards to choose three random monsters, four
random heros, and eight village cards. 

For a longer game, try four or more monsters.

> randomizedGame :: GameSetup
> randomizedGame = do
>     monsters <- shuffle [MonsterAbyssal .. MonsterUndeadSpirit]
>     heroes <- shuffle [HeroAmazon .. HeroThyrian]
>     village <- shuffle [ArcaneEnergies .. Warhammer]
>     return (take 3 monsters, take 4 heroes, take 8 village)

Specify the cards in the game.  If not enough are specified, randomly
choose from the remaining cards.  If too many are specified, randomly
choose among the specified cards.

> specifiedGame :: [MonsterType] -> [HeroType] -> [VillageCard] -> GameSetup

There are ten cards for each class.  Take all 30 Monster cards that match
the three selected classes and shuffle them together.  This becomes the
Dungeon Deck.  Count off ten Monster cards (without revealing them) and
shuffle them together with the special Thunderstone card.  Place these
eleven cards at the bottom of the Dungeon Deck.

Place both level 3 Hero cards in the stack.  Next, place all four level
2 Hero cards on top of the stack.  Finally, place all six level 1 Hero
cards on top of those.  This will create a stack of Hero cards with all
level 3 cards on the bottom, the level 2 cards in the middle, and the
level 1 cards on top.

There are 15 of each basic card and 8 of each village card.

Nonactive players may need to take actions due to card effects.

The active player must either Visit the Village or Enter the Dungeon or Rest.

Visit the Village
1. Reveal your hand
2. Use Village Effects
3. Produce gold
4. Purchase card(s)
5. Level up Hero cards
6. End turn

Enter the Dungeon
1. Reveal your hand
2. Use DungeonEffects
3. Select Monster and rank to attack
4. Resolve the battle
   a. Calculate Attack Value
   b. Resolve Battle Effects
   c. Undefeated Monster to bottom of Dungeon Deck
   d. Defeated Monster and Disease in discard pile
   e. Receive spoils
   f. Resolve Breach Effects
5. End turn

Rest
1. Destroy one card
2. End turn

The discard deck is only shuffled when no cards remain in your deck and
you need to draw cards.  All cards in the discard pile are shuffled
together.

When you level up, destroy the Hero card in your hand and pay the level
cost of the Hero card in Experience Points.  Then, search the stack of
matching Hero cards in the Village and find the card showing the next
higher level for the Hero type you destroyed.  Place this card on the
top of your discard pile.  Level 1 Heroes level up to 2, and Level 2
level up to 3.  However, you may not level the same Hero card twice in
one turn, i.e. from Level 1 to 3, and you may never skip a Level.
