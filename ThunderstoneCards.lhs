MAGIC ATTACK +4

DUNGEON: You may return one Monster to the bottom of the deck and
refill the hall before the beginning of a battle.

Elf Sorcerer/Archmage: When a Monster is returned to the bottom of
the monster deck, refill the Dungeon Hall.  If this results in a
Breach effect, resolve it immediately.  If the Thunderstone moves
to Rank 1 of the Dungeon Hall, the game ends immediately; you do
not collect the Thunderstone.
